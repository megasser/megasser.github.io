  <h1>Human Terrain System</h1>
  <ul class='incremental'>
    <li>Anthropologists and other social scientists embedded with US
  military in Afghanistan and Iraq to influence the "human
  terrain"</li>
    <li>Origin of the term "human terrain": HUAC report on "Guerrilla
  Warfare Advocates in the United States" (1968): "irregular
  forces…possess the ability to seize and retain the initiative
  through a superior control of the human terrain."</li> 
  <li>Official goal: "moving the population's 'center of gravity' from favoring the
  resistance forces' agenda to favoring the occupying 'coalition'
  forces and their agenda"</li>
  <li>Additional, unofficial goals: "gathering intelligence useful for supporting
  kinetic operations" (~30% of effort), measuring the effectiveness of military
  operations</li>
  <li>Training: "to win anthropologists over to their military
  culture's world view and values or to marginalize and force the
  non-compliant to resign" (John Allison, HTT participant)</li>
<!--  <li>"Profit and control": John Allison -->
<!--  <li>"Surveillance ethnography": David Price</li> -->
<!--  <li>"Attacking them because they resisted invasion": JA</li> -->
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h1>The Minerva Research Initiative</h1>
  <ul class='incremental'>
  <li>"A DoD-sponsored, university-based social science research
  initiative that focuses on areas of strategic importance to the
    U.S. national security policy"</li>
    <li>"Supporting social science for a safer world"</li>
    <li>"It is far more effective and economical to avoid
  insurgency through essentially constructive efforts than to counter
  it after it has grown into a full-scale movement requiring
  drastically greater effort."
    </li>
<!--  <li>In first year funding split between DoD and NSF; later only
  DoD</li> -->
    <li>Programs
    <ul>
      <li>University research grants: 70 3+-year grants to date</li>
      <li>Investing in the defense experts who teach our future
  military and national security leaders at professional military
      education (PME) institutions and military service academies
      </li>
      <li>Collaborating with the US Institute of Peace to offer
  dissertation fellowships and early career faculty awards</li>
    <li>Annual fall conference since 2011</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Universities as centers
  <ul>
  <li>Learning from mistakes of previous efforts</li>
  <li>Goal of improving relations between DoD and universities, creating a cadre
  of social scientists sympathetic to the military's mission</li>
  <li>Outsourcing of military's work to universities</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Example projects
  <ul>
    <li>New book: "The Three Pillars of Radicalization: Needs,
    Narratives, and Networks".
    START Headquarters, U of MD, College Park.
    </li>
    <li>Who does not become a terrorist and why: "interviews with (ten
  or more) activists and militants in parties and NGOs who, though
  sympathetic to radical causes, have chosen a path of non-violence."
    </li>
    <li>An empirical model "of the dynamics of social movement
  mobilisation and contagions"; "to identify individuals mobilised in
  a social contagion and when they become mobilised." 
    </li>
    <li>"Seeks to uncover the conditions under which political
  movements aimed at large-scale political and economic change
  originate," along with their "characteristics and consequences."

  <h1>Support from anthropologists</h1>
  <ul class='incremental'>
      <li>Open, unblemished support for the military mission</li>
      <li>A kinder, gentler war on terror: changing the military from within</li>
      <li>Better "good" than "bad" anthropologists" argument (Anna
      Simons, 2002, NPR)</li>

 <h1>Opposition from anthropologists</h1>
  <ul class='incremental'>
      <li>Network of Concerned Anthropologists (2007-), <i>The
      Counter-Counterinsurgency Manual</i> (2009)</li>
<!--      <li>The AAA position (Statement on Ethics, 1967; Principles of
  Professional Practice, 1971); "secret research", "secret reports,
      debriefings"</li>
-->
   <li>Professional reasons
      <ul>
      <li>Threatened confidence from communities studied,
      information used to control or annihilate communities</li>
      <li>Wariness of support from a powerful external client
      interested in applying the results (or information)
      </li>
    <li>What research gets funded: lack of DoD infrastructure for peer review,
    skewing in who applies
    </li>
    <li>Undercuts critical thinking: "the military definition of
  reality. This entails seeing the world as a series of threats to be
  dealt with, sorting people into enemies and allies, and focusing on
  the use or threat of force" (Lutz, 2008).</li>
    <li>How can anthropologists challenge (or study those challenging)
  the State when they're working for it?
    </li>
    <li>Gusterson: "Pentagon’s long term goal is to develop a cadre of
  social scientists, particularly in anthropology, who are tied to the
  military and its projects"
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What is not studied: climate change, inequality, job loss, disease,
  nuclear proliferation, massive migration, food shortages,
  problems generated by the Pentagon itself?</li>
    <li>What is studied and how it's used
    <ul>
      <li>How is "terrorism" defined?</li>
 <li>HTS training scenarios situated in US, with radical
 environmentalists as the enemy: will the results of the research be applied to us?</li>
  <li>Nafeez Ahmed (2014): "In their unswerving mission to defend an increasingly unpopular
 global system serving the interests of a tiny minority, security
 agencies have no qualms about painting the rest of us as potential
 terrorists."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Summary critiques
<ul>
  <li>David Price: "Minerva is farming out the piece-work of empire in ways
  that can allow individuals to disassociate their individual
  contributions from the larger project."
  <li>Hugh Gusterson: "It is my most profound hope that anthropologists
  will refuse to transform their discipline into one that uses a
  rhetorical patina of cross-cultural understanding and harm reduction
  to mask a project that would understand the other in order to
  subjugate and control it. This would be a betrayal of our human
  subjects and of our vocation as interlocutors of the other."
  </li>
  <li>Catherine Lutz (2008): "To join this project is to lend scholarship’s good
  name to a [similarly] grandiose, dangerous, and irrelevant project of
  building a better way to make war and maintain US military dominance
  of the globe."
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<!--
  <li>Ethical concerns: how Iraqi documents "came into the possession"
  of DoD</li>
     <li>Not applied social science but functioning as "supplying
      information to a powerful client" (Horowitz, 1967)
      </li>
      <li>"Scholars are wary of support from an external source with
      an interest in applying the results" (Engermann, 2009)</li>
   <li>AAA president: "we are concerned that the Department of Defense would turn
  for assistance in developing a selection process to those who are
  not intimately familiar with the rigorous standards of our
    discipline."
