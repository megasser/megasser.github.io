  <h1>Reponse of anthropologists and other social scientists (pre-Minerva)</h1>
  <ul class='incremental'>
    <li>Opposition
    <ul>
      <li>The AAA position (Statement on Ethics, 1967; Principles of
  Professional Practice, 1971); "secret research", "secret reports,
      debriefings"</li>
      <li>Opposition: threatened confidence from communities studied,
      information used to control or annihilate communities</li>
      <li>Network of Concerned Anthropologists (2007-), <i>The
      Counter-Counterinsurgency Manual</i> (2009)</li>
      <li>"scholars are wary of support from an external source with
      an interest in applying the results" (Engermann, 2009)</li>
      <li>Not applied social scientists but functioning as "supplying
      information to a powerful client" (Horowitz, 1967)
      </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Support
    <ul>
      <li>(Official) "it is far more effective and economical to avoid
  insurgency through essentially constructive efforts than to counter
  it after it has grown into a full-scale movement requiring
  drastically greater effort."
      <li>The "bad anthropology" argument (Anna Simons, 2002, NPR)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

<div class='slide'>
  <h1>The Minerva Research Initiative: responses</h1>
  <ul class='incremental'>
    <li>Ethical concerns: how Iraqi documents "came into the
    possession" DoD
    </li>
    <li>Selection biases, lack of DoD infrostructure for peer review;
    skewing in who applies
    </li>
    <li>Gunderson: "Pentagon’s long term goal is to develop a cadre of
  social scientists, particularly in anthropology, who are tied to the
  military and its projects"
    <li>AAA president: "we are concerned that the Department of Defense would turn
  for assistance in developing a selection process to those who are
  not intimately familiar with the rigorous standards of our
    discipline."
    </li>
    <li>Undercuts critical thinking: "the military definition of
  reality. This entails seeing the world as a series of threats to be
  dealt with, sorting people into enemies and allies, and focusing on
  the use or threat of force".</li>
  <li>What about climate change, inequality, job loss, disease,
  nuclear proliferation, massive migration, food shortages,
  problems generated by the Pentagon itself?</li>
  <li>How is "terrorism" defined?</li>
  <li>Gusterson: "It is my most profound hope that anthropologists
  will refuse to transform their discipline into one that uses a
  rhetorical patina of cross-cultural understanding and harm reduction
  to mask a project that would understand the other in order to
  subjugate and control it. This would be a betrayal of our human
  subjects and of our vocation as interlocutors of the other."
  </li>
  <li>How can anthropologists challenge (or study those challenging)
  the State when they're working for it?
  </li>
  <li>Lutz (2008): "To join this project is to lend scholarship’s good
  name to a similarly grandiose, dangerous, and irrelevant project of
  building a better way to make war and maintain US military dominance
  of the globe."
